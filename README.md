# Spam Detection with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This notebook demonstrates the creation and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for spam detection. The model is designed to classify emails as either spam or non-spam (ham). Key steps in this notebook include:

## Key Steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Load the dataset containing emails labeled as spam or ham.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the text data by performing one-hot encoding, tokenization, and padding.

3. **Model Architecture**: Define the architecture of the CNN model, specifying layers, filters, and activation functions.

4. **Model Compilation**: Compile the model by specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

5. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model on the preprocessed text data.

6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained model on a test set to assess its performance.

7. **Illustration of Results**: Display key metrics and visualizations to understand the model's behavior.

This notebook serves as a practical example of utilizing CNNs for text classification, specifically for spam detection in emails. It provides insights into the model's accuracy and performance.
